**The Switch is switched off once the temperature falls below 18 and then it is turned on when the temperature is more than 21. Identify the Equivalence values which belong to the same class.**
  - a)    12,16,22
  - b)    24,27,17
  - c)    22,23,24
  - d)    14,15,19

**Solution**
The equivalence partitioning clesses will be 
 - 1. less than 18
 - 2. 18 - 21
 - 3. greater than 21
 Only in c) all values are from the same class(3). So the answer is c) 22,23,24
